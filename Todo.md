# ResQ  

A minimalist tool to find nearby hospital beds efficiently. 

# PRIMARY GOAL

* List hospitals and the number of beds.
* Update status of the hospital beds realtime(Occupied/Empty)
* A searchable map to show available Hospitals near user. 
    

# USERS  

* **Patient** - Users who are seeking CCU/ICU 
* **Updater** - Volunteers to update hospital stats. e.g. status of ICU beds.
* **Moderator** -  Could be doctors/patients/hospital stuff to validate volunteers input data.
* **Public User** - general users with ability to report wrong information. 

# Some More Idea

* Link users with emergency services such as Ambulance, Doctors, etc.
* Make Public API so that other similar applications can benefit from it.
* Release public dataset to provide healthcare system insights for researchers.
